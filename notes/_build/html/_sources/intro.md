# Notes on Reinforcement Learning


These are my notes on reinforcement learning, primarily based on Sutton and Barto's Reinforcement Learning and the Berkeley CS285: Deep Reinforcement Learning course. The notes are organized into three main sections:

1. Markov Decision Process
2. Value-Based Methods
3. Policy-Based Methods

And I'm currently in the process of adding model based methods!
